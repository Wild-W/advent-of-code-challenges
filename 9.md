Challenge 9 was tough, but I perservered.

The trick to this challenge was figuring out how a rope moves in response to its head's movement, which I handled in my `Knot` class like so:

```cpp
void cont() {
    if (this->next) {
        this->next->follow(this->x, this->y);
    }
    else {
        this->positions.insert({this->x, this->y});
    }
}

void move(char direction, int amount) {
    for (int i = 0; i < amount; i++) {
        this->x += directions[direction].first;
        this->y += directions[direction].second;

        if (this->next) {
            this->next->follow(this->x, this->y);
        }
    }
}

void follow(const int x, int y) {
    if (abs(x - this->x) <= 1 && abs(y - this->y) <= 1) {
        return;
    }

    if (x > this->x) {
        this->x++;
    }
    else if (x < this->x) {
        this->x--;
    }

    if (y > this->y) {
        this->y++;
    }
    else if (y < this->y) {
        this->y--;
    }

    this->cont();
}
```

First we move the head `Knot`, then we recursively move the tailing `Knot`s in response, making sure to return early if the head `Knot` is still adjacent to the next `Knot` in its rope.

The `cont` function determines what should be done after a tailing `Knot` is moved. If there is more rope remaining, it runs `follow` on the next `Knot`, otherwise it adds a new position to the `positions` set of the final knot.

Positions is defined as follows:
```cpp
set<pair<int, int>> positions;
```
For the tail `Knot`, positions is initialized with a single `pair<int, int>` of `{0, 0}`.

`positions` is a set because when inserting a value into a set, if it is a duplicate it will automatically be removed. To get the total positions, we just call `positions.size()`.
